            <p>
              <strong>October 12th, 2013</strong> - It was a cold Saturday
              morning. I was at a conference in Germany and started to feel very
              sick. I could barely move, but I had to take a plane to speak at
              another conference in Spain. In the middle of the flight, I called
              the flight attendant and said I needed help.{' '}

                The airplane landed, and I left there in an ambulance
              </span>
              .
            </p>
            <p>
              I went to the hospital, took some blood tests, and started to feel
              better again. I thought it was just a food poisoning, and I was
              ready to leave that place. They got the results and{' '}

              I was having an episode of Pancreatitis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two days later, I was still at the hospital. My blood results were
              pretty bad, they didn't allow me to leave, so I asked a co-worker
              to bring my laptop. At least with the internet, I could{' '}

              One day I left my room to get some water.{' '}
              <span className="highlight">
                When I got back, my computer was stolen

            <p>
              I was completely devastated. That computer was the only way I
              could communicate with my family in Brazil. How could someone
              steal from a person in a hospital bed? I couldn't believe that
              whole situation.

              The next day, my co-workers tried to cheer me up and{' '}
              <span className="highlight">brought a new laptop for me</span>. I
              had no backup to restore from, so I started to install everything
              back again. For every code editor, for every terminal app, I had
              to choose a different theme.

            <p>
              I always believed in the cost of context switching. I know how it
              feels when you're <em>"in the zone"</em>, then suddenly, you get
              distracted and lose focus. It shouldn't be that way, so{' '}

              I stayed in that hospital bed for 3 weeks. I can't even describe
              the feeling of being sick in a foreign country, alone and away
              from your family.

            <p>Thanks Dracula, for distracting me when I needed the most.</p>
