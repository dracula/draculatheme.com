On February 11th, Dracula PRO was being launched.

Today, exactly six months later, more than 1,143 copies have been sold. What started as a simple side project, became something much bigger.

Maintaining a high-quality theme is not easy. Each application has a different syntax highlighter, theme system, and other peculiarities, which makes the process of standardizing even harder.

That's why we're announcing the end of the Launch Promo.

In a couple of days, the price will increase to $79.
