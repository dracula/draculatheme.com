**TL;DR We decided to sunset Dracula UI to have more time for [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com), [Dracula PRO](https://draculatheme.com/pro), and some new projects in 2024.**

## The beginning

Back in 2020, [Netto Farah](https://twitter.com/nettofarah) and I started working on [Dracula UI](https://ui.draculatheme.com/), a set of accessible, reusable, and composable React components that follow the Dracula color palette.

At that time, we felt like there was an opportunity to build a UI library that was not only beautiful but also dark-mode-first and easy to use.

## The launch

After a few months of development, we launched the first version of Dracula UI in [April 2021](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1382334469370224645).

When Dracula UI was first released, it was a paid product hosted on GitHub as a private repository and a private package.

This was a good way to kick off the project and get feedback from a small group. However, it was not a great way to distribute the package since it required authentication to install locally.

## The continuation

On [September 2022](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1575476765228560384), we decided to make Dracula UI free and open source.

The idea was to facilitate the usage, deployment, and contribution of the community.

Although we knew that was the right decision, we also knew it would require a lot of work to maintain it.

## The world today

Our goal is always to overdeliver and push the bar regarding quality, but we don't feel like we're doing that with this project.

Nowadays, there are many UI libraries out there like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) which are far better than Dracula UI.

So we decided to sunset Dracula UI to have more time for [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com), [Dracula PRO](https://draculatheme.com/pro), and some new projects in 2024.

The code will still be [available on GitHub](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-ui), but we won't be making more contributions.

## The future

Thank you all for the support and feedback during this journey.

We really appreciate the time and energy you spent with us.
