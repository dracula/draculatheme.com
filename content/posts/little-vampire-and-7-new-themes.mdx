Say hello to my newest little vampire - Victoria Rocha ;)

For the next few weeks, I'll be out on paternity leave. This means that I'll be slow to respond to emails, Discord messages, and GitHub issues.

Thank you for being patient as I navigate life as a new dad &lt;3

## Dracula in the wild

I love this setup that was shared on the [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/pqrb42/kde_my_first_ever_rice_pop_os_with_kde_and_the/) Reddit.

It features the [Pop!\_OS wallpaper](https://github.com/dracula/wallpaper/blob/master/pop.png), Ubuntu Mono font, Neovim, and the [Fish terminal theme](/fish).

The [@redbrain](https://redbrain.github.io/) user shared on Discord his Dracula setup in [Frescobaldi](https://frescobaldi.org/).

Frescobaldi is software for engraving music in the LilyPond language. How awesome is that?!
