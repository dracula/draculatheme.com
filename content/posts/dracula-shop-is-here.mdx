There are **12 custom-designed items** over there, such as t-shirts, stickers, hoodies, pins, pullovers, hats, and even baby clothing.

I'm doing a hybrid of **small production runs** and **print-on-demand**. For things like stickers and pins, I'm ordering a few items at a time, so you might need to be fast to get it while it's 🔥.

Some items will be **limited edition**. Once it's gone, it's gone forever.

For things like t-shirts and hoodies, I'm doing print-on-demand, which allows me to be **more flexible** with stock and sizes (think of 3XL, 4XL).

It's all available as **pre-orders**, which will be processed on February 28th.

For years I wanted to have a Dracula t-shirt, and now it's a reality. **Thank you** to all developers who got Dracula Pro and Dracula UI - you made this possible.
