Since my last email, I got a LOT of responses about doing Dracula merch. I started ordering some samples to learn more about how can I make the absolute best products possible.

So far, I've spent $498.52 buying multiple types of t-shirts, hoodies, and joggers.

I ordered different shirts made of 100% cotton and tri-blend (50% polyester, 25% combed ring-spun cotton, 25% rayon). I also tried different colors and printing techniques like DTG (Direct-To-Garment), Screen Printing, and Embroidery.

This has been a super interesting process since I'm able to discard many things that simply won't meet the quality standards that I'm looking for.

I can't wait to make this available to you and I hope you liked these behind-the-scenes pictures :)

## New on Dracula

Say hello to the 3 new themes that joined Dracula this week.

- [Gajim](/gajim): a fully-featured **XMPP client**
- [GitHub](/github): a **web-based theme** using the Stylus browser extension
- [Warp](/warp): a blazingly fast, **Rust-based terminal**

## Dracula in the wild

I'm always amazed by how small changes can have a big impact. This week Stephen tweeted about changing his setup to Dracula and the difference was huge, you can [check the full picture](https://twitter.com/hi_stephen_n/status/1480765091121221632) to see the side-by-side comparison.

From what I can tell, he installed the [ZSH theme](/zsh) and the [iTerm theme](/iterm) too.
