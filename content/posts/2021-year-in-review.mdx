Transparency is a major value for me, so I thought it would be nice to gather some interesting numbers about Dracula in 2021.

## High Level

**Open Source**

We started the year with 144 themes, and now there are 232 themes!

That's 88 new themes in only one year. I'm beyond grateful for this amazing community that keeps building awesome stuff consistently.

**Website**

This website is a crucial piece of the entire project. It's where people can read instructions on how to install a theme and also discover new themes.

In 2020, 684,155 people visited the website, which generated a total of 1,975,525 pageviews.

In 2021, there were 771,936 people visiting the website, generating a total of 2,504,245 pageviews.

That's a 12% growth in visitors and 26% growth in pageviews.

**Revenue**

To keep this whole engine running, I started to monetize this project.

In 2020, it generated $87,683.81 in revenue. In 2021, it generated $134,217.46.

That's a 53% increase - more details below.

## Revenue

[Dracula PRO](/pro) was launched on February 11th, 2020, and made $87,683.81 from 1,656 users in its first year.

In 2021, it made $114,008.47 from 2,019 users which is mind-blowing.
