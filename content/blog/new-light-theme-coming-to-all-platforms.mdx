We're introducing a new light theme to Dracula.

It's a variation of Alucard, but now as an open-source project with a slightly different flavor, inspired by the late 1800s, which is when [Bram Stoker wrote the original Dracula book.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula) üìí

Over the past few weeks, we've been working intensively to bring this new variant to all of you. This includes a brand **new specification with completely new colors,** [available here](/spec) for community contributions. üß©

## Why now?

For years, we've heard the same question: "_Will you create a light theme?_", and our answer was always: "_**No.** Dracula doesn't support light._"

But a light theme goes beyond personal preference - it's essential for accessibility and usability in bright environments, especially for users with visual impairments.

üéØ After months of research and iterations, _we first brought_ [Alucard to Pro.](/blog/dracula-pro-2.0-our-first-light-theme) Now, it's time to make this **available to everyone** ‚Äî even those who don't have Pro yet.

But as with everything we do, we couldn't simply copy and paste, we had to examine every little detail. That's why we've brought the same concept in a different flavor. üíõ
