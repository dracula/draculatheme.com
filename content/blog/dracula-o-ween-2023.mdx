I've got some chilling news (_I promise, it's the good kind_)! ðŸŽƒðŸ‘»

**Dracula Pro is now at a fang-tastic 40% discount!** If the thought of grabbing the Pro version has been haunting your mind or you're considering it as a treat for a friend, seize the moment. **Use promo code: [DRACULAOWEEN2023](https://draculatheme.gumroad.com/l/dracula-pro/DRACULAOWEEN2023).**

But remember, every spell has its time limit. This bewitching offer fades away in **48 hours.** So don't be left howling in regret.

## A New Era for Dracula

Following our recent [website revamp](https://draculatheme.com/blog/celebrating-10-years-of-dracula), we've bidden goodbye to Google Analytics, embracing the privacy-first, open-source alternative - Plausible Analytics. Although there was a brief hiccup with our visitor counts due to the GA changes, all is in order now.

Did you uncover all our hidden easter eggs?

## For vampires who conquered the sun

We're excited to give you a little preview of our next light theme. That's right, Dracula Pro is opening its doors to Alucard, the famous vampire who dared to defy the sun.

Incorporating a light theme into Dracula Pro is a way to offer more customization options; the new variant, called Alucard, will maintain the Count's elegant and sophisticated essence but with a touch of lightness.

We look forward to sharing more details about Alucard soon. Get ready for a bright theme that doesn't fear daylight and is sure to be a stunning look.
