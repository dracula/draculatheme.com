The wait is over... [Dracula Pro is live](/pro)!

This is a very special moment for me. It's been almost 7 years since I launched Dracula, and I'm super excited about this next step.

The original colors created in 2013 were based on personal taste. This new Pro version brings a more refined and mathematical approach that **normalizes lightness and saturation**.

Dracula Pro comes with 6 theme variations for 10 different apps such as Alfred, Hyper, iTerm, JetBrains IDEs, Slack, Sublime Text, Terminal.app, Visual Studio Code, Xcode, and ZSH.

Plus, 4 hand-picked fonts with ligatures and a screencast with my personal productivity tips.

On top of that, I'm also working on an e-book about the habits of highly productive developers, which will be released in Q2 2020.

I put a lot of energy to prepare all this for you and I hope you love Dracula Pro as much as I do.

Thanks for your support over the years!

P.S.: It will help a lot if you share this with your friends: [draculatheme.com/pro](/pro)
