## Why Dracula Pro

The wait is over... [Dracula Pro is live](/pro)!

This is a very special moment for our team. It’s been almost 7 years since Dracula launched, and we are incredibly excited about this next step.

The original colors created in 2013 were based on personal taste. This new Pro version brings a more refined and mathematical approach that **normalizes lightness and saturation**.

## What’s inside

Dracula Pro comes with 6 theme variations for 10 different apps such as Alfred, Hyper, iTerm, JetBrains IDEs, Slack, Sublime Text, Terminal.app, Visual Studio Code, Xcode, and ZSH.

Plus, 4 hand-picked fonts with ligatures and a screencast with our personal productivity tips.

On top of that, we are also working on an e-book about the habits of highly productive developers, which will be released in Q2 2020.

We poured a lot of energy into preparing all this for you and hope you love Dracula Pro as much as we do.

Thanks for your support over the years!
