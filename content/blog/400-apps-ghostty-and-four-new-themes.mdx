Today, we are celebrating **400 supported apps!** 🎉

Thank you! Whether you're maintaining a port, contributing via a pull request, or reporting an issue, the community is the heart and soul of the Dracula Theme.

## Welcome Ghostty

Over the past few weeks, we've been using [**Ghostty**](https://ghostty.org) ourselves and have fallen in love with it.

Ghostty is a fast, feature-rich, cross-platform terminal emulator that uses platform-native UI and GPU acceleration.

Now, you can use the [open source theme](/ghostty) and we're also shipping a [Dracula Pro theme](https://draculatheme.gumroad.com/l/dracula-pro/WELCOMEGHOSTTY) for both the dark & light variations.

## New on Dracula

We have five new additions to the clan:

- [Google Search](/google-search): that site we used to use before AI was a thing; 😅
- [Codeforces](/codeforces): a competitive programming platform with challenges and contests;
- [Evidence](/evidence): a data analysis and visualization system based on SQL and Markdown;
- [Ghostty](/ghostty): a modern terminal emulator focused on performance and low latency;
- [Keybr](/keybr): an interactive application for keyboard typing practice and improvement;

## New on Dracula Pro

We're excited to announce the beta release of one of our most requested features: exclusive access to Dracula Pro's private organization! 🧩

With this access, you can create issues with your valuable feedback and even contribute directly to development.

If you are interested in helping us refine our apps support or are an advanced user who wants to download the package directly from GitHub, [fill out this form.](/pro/request-access)

**Q:** Where does Dracula go swimming?

**A:** The Dead Sea. 💀
