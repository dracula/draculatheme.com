Today, we are celebrating **400 supported apps!** 🎉

Thank you! Whether you're maintaining a port, contributing via a pull request, or reporting an issue, the community is the heart and soul of the Dracula Theme.

## 👻 Welcome Ghostty

Over the past few weeks, we've been using [**Ghostty**](https://ghostty.org) ourselves and have fallen in love with it.

Ghostty is a fast, feature-rich, cross-platform terminal emulator that uses platform-native UI and GPU acceleration.

Now, you can use the [open source theme](/ghostty) and we're also shipping a [Dracula Pro theme](https://draculatheme.gumroad.com/l/dracula-pro/WELCOMEGHOSTTY) for both the dark & light variations.

## ✨ New on Dracula

We have five new additions to the clan:

- [Google Search](/google-search): that site we used to use before AI was a thing; 😅
- [Codeforces](/codeforces): a competitive programming platform with challenges and contests;
- [Evidence](/evidence): a data analysis and visualization system based on SQL and Markdown;
- [Ghostty](/ghostty): a modern terminal emulator focused on performance and low latency;
- [Keybr](/keybr): an interactive application for keyboard typing practice and improvement;

## ⭐ New on Dracula Pro

We're excited to announce the beta release of one of our most requested features: exclusive access to Dracula Pro's private organization! 🧩

With this access, you can create issues with your valuable feedback and even contribute directly to development.

**Q:** Where does Dracula go swimming?

**A:** The Dead Sea. 💀
