Today I'm writing from San Francisco, where my car just got stolen.

It's been a while since I don't send these Dracula updates, right? The main reason is that I've been building a new email platform - [Resend](https://resend.com).

So far, Resend has only been used to send transactional emails, but we're now adding the ability to send broadcast emails.

This is still under a feature flag, but I'm happy to say that all Dracula emails are no longer being sent via Mailchimp and are now fully migrated to Resend.
