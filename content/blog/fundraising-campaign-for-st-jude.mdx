Throughout this month, we'll allocate a portion of Dracula Pro sales to help the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

This institution has helped increase the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% in 1962 to 80% today.

There are many devtools participating, and you can donate here: [codinginpublic.dev](https://codinginpublic.dev/fundraiser?ref=draculatheme.com)
