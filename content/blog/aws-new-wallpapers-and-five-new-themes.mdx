A couple of days ago, I was configuring some stuff on AWS and noticed that they are using Dracula! Can you believe that? Even Amazon is using Dracula üò±

For us on the Dracula team, wallpapers are something meticulously chosen. After all, they keep the vampiric aesthetic and add personality to our machines.

With that in mind, we updated the wallpaper pack with a [new collection](https://github.com/dracula/wallpaper/tree/master/second-collection), including this one:

## ü¶á New on Dracula PRO

Earlier last week, we published an updated version of the pack with a complete overhaul of the theme for the Alacritty app. We fixed and adjusted our theme and all variants to the most modern app standards.

We're also launching the [Dracula PRO Changelog](/pro/changelog). Our users have been asking for it for a long time, and after several iterations, we built this one with great love and care.
