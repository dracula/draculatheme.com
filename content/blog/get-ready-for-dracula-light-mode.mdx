For years, we heard the same question, _“Are you going to create a light color scheme?”_ and the answer always was, _“Nope. Dracula can’t stand the light”_.

But a light theme **isn’t solely a matter of taste**; It is **imperative for accessibility** and usability in light conditions. It is essential to accommodate people with visual impairments and ensure legibility in brighter light.

That’s why we decided to work on something new...

The light theme will be called **_“Alucard”_** which is **_Dracula_** spelled backward 😅, which fits perfectly into the context of this new iteration.

> “In truth, I may have been frightened, scared to confront my own father.” - Alucard

Alucard is a half-human, half-vampire dhampir who uniquely bridges two worlds, like our project’s journey to embrace light and dark modes.

We’re making a ton of progress in the new light theme iterations and have reached the final palette (_probably_). The next step is to run a beta program with a small group of people.
