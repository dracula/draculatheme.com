This year, Dracula **turns 11,** and it has become the most used theme out there, serving millions of developers and enthusiasts worldwide.

We also launched our first light theme, **Alucard,** which is perfect for those working in brighter environments.

2025 is almost here and we have even more plans for it. Thank you for the support, and stay tuned for what's coming! 😉
