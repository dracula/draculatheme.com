I'm super happy to announce _Purchasing Parity Power_ on [Dracula Pro](/pro)!

Why? Because not **everyone earns in dollars**.

Now 160 countries have unique discounts based on their currency value and social climate ðŸ’š

It took me an entire Saturday, but I managed to build my own solution using Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Gumroad. If you're interested in implementing something like this too, I shared some resources that were useful to me on Twitter.

## New on Dracula

This week 4 new themes have joined the Dracula clan!

- [Bashtop](/bashtop): Linux/OSX/FreeBSD **resource monitor tool**
- [LiteIDE](/liteide): A simple, open source, **cross-platform Go IDE**
- [Logseq](/logseq): Privacy-first platform for **knowledge sharing**
- [Thunderbird](/thunderbird): The good ol' **email client** from Mozilla

## New on Dracula Pro

I just added the Portuguese and Spanish versions of my book 14 Habits of Highly Productive Developers into the Dracula Pro package. Enjoy ;)

Happy hacking!
