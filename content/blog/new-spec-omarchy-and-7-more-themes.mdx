We have launched a dedicated page with the new [Dracula Theme specification.](/spec)

This includes our new color scheme - **Alucard**. We have organized our themes into two sections: **Open Source** (free like the original Dracula and Alucard) and [Pro (with the premium variants you already know).](/pro)

This page facilitates contributions and implementations, offering clearer guidelines for all platforms. It's an _extensive_ read for anyone who wants to implement the themes correctly.

## Subtle Website Redesign

We have quietly renovated our site to reflect our evolution as a project. The new design preserves the Dracula aesthetic while improving usability and highlighting our expanding ecosystem.

Here's the tech stack we chose: [React](https://react.dev/?ref=draculatheme.com), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/?ref=draculatheme.com), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/?ref=draculatheme.com), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/?ref=draculatheme.com), [Motion](https://motion.dev/?ref=draculatheme.com), and [more](https://github.com/dracula/draculatheme.com/blob/main/package.json?ref=draculatheme.com).

You can find the source code at: [github.com/dracula/draculatheme.com](https://github.com/dracula/draculatheme.com/?ref=draculatheme.com). üç¶ The more _observant vampires_ will notice various special details.

## Fundraising campaign

This year, we are pleased to [participate once again](/blog/fundraising-campaign-for-st-jude) in the **St. Jude Children's Research Hospital** fundraising campaign. This institution has transformed the childhood cancer landscape, increasing the survival rate from 20% in 1962 to an impressive 80% today.

Various devtools are participating, and you can contribute at [codinginpublic.dev/fundraiser.](https://codinginpublic.dev/fundraiser?ref=draculatheme.com)

## The end

**Q:** What do you call a careful Wolf?

**A:** Aware-wolf. üê∫

**P.S.:** We're getting too good at these jokes - should we be worried?! ü§£
