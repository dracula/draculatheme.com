We're excited to announce the launch of Alucard, the official Dracula light theme.

## ⚡ About Alucard

Alucard is a playful nod to the famous Dracula, with the name spelled backward. This new variant is perfect for those who work in **brighter environments.**

Our meticulous approach to meeting **WCAG AA contrast standards** has been a significant part of our journey. This commitment to accessibility has led to many iterations, fine adjustments, and even the expansion of our spec.
