JetBrains just released a new version called **2021.2**, so if you use IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, CLion, DataGrip, or RubyMine, it's time to update your Dracula PRO plugin.

## 150k Mark

One of my goals with Dracula PRO is to be as transparent as possible. This includes opening revenue numbers and sharing what happened along the way (even when it's not good).

Yesterday I noticed that we just hit $151,328.16 in sales and I decided to write a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1420744224417353729) with some lessons learned, along with an update to the [Dracula PRO Journey](/pro/journey) page.

Thank you for making this journey possible, I hope these insights are helpful! üôè
