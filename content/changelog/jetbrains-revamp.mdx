## Highlights

I received some emails asking why the JetBrains IDEs themes were so different than the VSCode and Sublime themes.

Although all editors are different and it's not possible to have a 100% match, that feedback was completely right, so we decided to rethink the entire JetBrains theme. Here's the result:

### After

Not only the sidebar, file tree, tabs, and line numbers were updated. We also revisited the syntax highlighting for all languages.
