I received some emails asking why the JetBrains IDEs themes were so different than the VSCode and Sublime themes.

Although all editors are different and it's not possible to have a 100% match, those feedbacks were completely right, so I decided to rethink the entire JetBrains theme. Here's the result:

**Before**:

**After**:

Not only the sidebar, file tree, tabs, and line numbers were updated. I also revisited the syntax highlighting for all languages.
