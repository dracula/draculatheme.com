## Highlights

As you know, Dracula Pro used to come with some videos. This made it difficult for folks to update their local themes, since the .zip package is quite large, and re-downloading it takes time. To help with that, we decided to remove the videos, which makes it 27% smaller now.

## JetBrains update

JetBrains just released a new version called **2022.1**, so if you use IntelliJ, PyCharm, CLion, DataGrip, WebStorm, or RubyMine, it's time to update your Dracula Pro plugin.
