### 🌄 Alucard – Dracula’s official light theme

Alucard is a playful nod to the famous Dracula, with a special twist—its name is Dracula spelt backwards. This new theme is perfect for those working in brighter environments and meets WCAG AA contrast standards.

Since [we announced it](/blog/get-ready-for-dracula-light-mode), we’ve made many iterations and adjustments to perfect this theme.
