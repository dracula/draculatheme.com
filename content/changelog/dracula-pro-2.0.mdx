We are thrilled to present the biggest update in Dracula PRO's history! 🤯

![Dracula PRO - Alucard var.](/images/blog/dracula-pro-2.0-our-first-light-theme-a.jpeg)

🌄 **Alucard - Dracula's Official Light Theme**

Alucard is a playful nod to the famous Dracula, with a special twist - its name is Dracula spelt backwards! This new theme is perfect for those working in brighter environments.

As with the other variants, this one (Alucard) also meets the WCAG AA contrast standards.

Since [we announced it](/blog/get-ready-for-dracula-light-mode), there have been many iterations and adjustments, and we hope you love this new theme as much as we enjoyed developing it!

🦇 **Dracula 2.0 Updates**

- **VS Code & Vim**: These have been completely redesigned from scratch! The main motivation was to refine and optimize what we already had and adapt it better to a clearer aesthetic and standards;
- **JetBrains Fleet & Legacy**: Although our goal is to support all JetBrains IDEs, we are initially launching with Fleet & Legacy (more on what this means below!) due to prioritization and availability constraints.

We've also made general improvements for nearly all apps, added new fonts, and updated previous ones to contain only their variable versions. Additionally, we've added:

- Raycast
- Zed

👋🏻 And we've said goodbye to Alfred, Atom, BetterDiscord, and Visual Studio.

Below is a complete list of currently supported applications:

- Alacritty
- Emacs
- Firefox
- Google Chrome
- Hyper
- Insomnia
- iTerm
- JetBrains IDEs
- Notepad++
- Raycast
- Slack
- Sublime
- Terminal App
- Vim
- VSCode
- Windows Terminal
- Xcode
- Zed

📝 **Additional Notes**

- **JetBrains Legacy**: the current version includes only JetBrains Fleet & Legacy, which contains themes for the apps that already had them but with critical fixes applied to these versions.
- **Future Plans**: We intend to bring a light theme to the open-source project, but we still need to figure out what this iteration will look like, and it won't be the Alucard present in Dracula PRO.

Remember, **you don't need to make a new purchase** to get all the updates in Dracula PRO 2.0; you can download the updates directly from your [Gumroad library](https://app.gumroad.com/library) using your existing account (the email you used to purchase the package).

🏁 **Conclusion**

We hope these updates and the launch of Alucard enhance your experience and add value to your workflow. Thank you for your continued support and dedication to our community! 💜
