## Highlights

Our users have long requested Dracula Pro support for Visual Studio, and it is finally here with all variants and as close as possible to its VSCode counterpart.

## Fixes

- We adjusted the background and selection color in Notepad++, which were overlapping and not giving the necessary highlight.
- We made a minor tweak to the Sublime Text instructions.
