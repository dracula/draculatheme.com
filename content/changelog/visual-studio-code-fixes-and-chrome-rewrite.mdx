## Highlights

This update brings fixes to Visual Studio Code and a ground-up rebuild of all Chrome theme variants, delivering better consistency and quality across the board.

## Visual Studio Code updates

We’ve applied several fixes and improvements across all Visual Studio Code variants and forks (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.):

- Corrected editor badge colors;
- Enhanced line highlight rendering;
- Adjusted status bar item colors;
- Fixed terminal decoration issues;

## Chrome complete rewrite

All seven Chrome variants (Alucard, Blade, Buffy, Lincoln, Morbius, Pro, and Van Helsing) have been rebuilt from scratch:

- Established consistent color patterns and element hierarchy across all variants;
- Improved manifest configuration;
- Streamlined build process with a new dedicated repository;
