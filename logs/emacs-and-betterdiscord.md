One of the most requested Dracula PRO themes is finally available! **Emacs** users, here it is! ðŸ˜‰

And last but not least, we now have support for **BetterDiscord** too!

This was one of the first times where we had _beta testers_ helping us **shape these PRO themes**. Keep an eye on [Discord](https://draculatheme.com/discord-invite) in case you wanna help ðŸ’–
