- JetBrains recently launched the **2020.3 stable version**. Two months ago I released an update for that, but many users didn't download it yet, so this is a friendly reminder to get the latest version.
- Monitors are getting bigger and bigger, so I decided to include a new **8K resolution wallpaper** for those people who enjoy the extra space.
- This is for those who are using the new **macOS Big Sur**. You probably noticed that Apple updated the desktop icons to a skeuomorphism style, so here's a new set of fresh icons for you to start using.
