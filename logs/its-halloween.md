Happy Halloween!

![Dracula Pro Halloween!](/static/img/logs/its-halloween-a.gif)

I just wanted to say THANKS to all of you.

There are now **1,588 Dracula PRO users**, which is absolutely insane.

On the open source side our clan continues to grow too, just take a look at these crazy numbers...

- 👻 VSCode: 1,661,819 users
- 🧟 JetBrains: 280,392 users
- 💀 Atom: 219,224 users

Because of your support, I'm able to maintain this huge community and continue to build the most used theme for developers.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! 💜
