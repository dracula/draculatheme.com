From Mosaic to Netscape to IE6.

We all love using browsers to navigate through this crazy world called the internet. We spend a lot of time on our code editors and terminals, but I bet we spend even more time on web browsers.

That's why having a Dracula PRO theme for the most popular browsers is not only cool; it's a must-have.

## Chrome

Starting with the most used browser in the world. Here are all six variations of Dracula PRO on Google Chrome.

## Firefox

Now let's talk about Mozilla's main project - Firefox. What I love about this theme are the accent colors present on the active tabs and buttons. It's a simple, gorgeous detail.
