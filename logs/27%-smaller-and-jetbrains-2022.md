As you know, Dracula PRO used to come with some videos. This made it difficult for folks to update their local themes, since the .zip package is quite large, and re-downloading it takes time. To help with that, I decided to remove the videos, which makes it 27% smaller now.

JetBrains just released a new version called **2022.1**, so if you use IntelliJ, PyCharm, CLion, DataGrip, WebStorm, or RubyMine, it's time to update your Dracula PRO plugin.
