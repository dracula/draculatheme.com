Atom, a code editor built by GitHub, was one of the most requested themes. I'm glad to announce that it's now available for PRO users.

## JetBrains Update

JetBrains has an Early Access Program (EAP) in which they provide a beta build of their IDEs. Starting today, Dracula PRO has support for those 2020.1 beta versions too.
