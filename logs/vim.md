The **#1 most requested Dracula PRO theme** is finally available!

Vim users, Neovim users, MacVim users, here it is ðŸ˜‰

![Dracula Pro for VIM](/static/img/logs/vim-a.png)

P.S.: This wouldn't be possible without the help of [D. Ben Knoble](https://github.com/benknoble) and the initial work done by [Derek Sifford](https://github.com/dsifford). You guys are the best!

## Wallpaper

I updated the wallpaper sizes to support 4k and 5k monitors.

## Color Palette

Besides providing the Dracula PRO colors in _HEX_, _RGB_, and _HSL_, I now added the _ANSI 256_ equivalent.

You can find them all inside `design/PALETTE.md`.
