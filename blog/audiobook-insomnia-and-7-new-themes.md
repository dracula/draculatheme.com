The last two weeks have been really busy. I decided to create this page to show [Dracula PRO's journey](/pro/journey) from $0 to $100k and it blew up. Since then, 218 people bought Dracula PRO, which represents $13,599.35.

If you're new here - welcome to the clan! üßõ

I'm not gonna pretend it was all good. To be quite frank, I wasn't expecting such a high volume of new users. This generated a flood of support emails and questions via DM. Taking care of all this alone has been very difficult, especially because I have a full-time job that consumes me a lot.

Still, I couldn't be more proud to see this community growing. üíú

## New on Dracula PRO

I've always believed that tools and hard skills are only a part of what makes a productive developer. That's why I decided to write a book about habits and soft skills.

After months of planning and editing, the audiobook is now available on [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B08WJMLJWN/?source_code=AUDFPWS0223189MWT-BK-ACX0-237602&ref=acx_bty_BK_ACX0_237602_rh_us). üéâ

I insisted on recording with my own voice, instead of some random guy who sounds like a robot. In total, there are 3 hours 21 minutes and 35 seconds of audio, which includes not only the content of the book but also extra comments that are made at the end of each chapter.

**Dracula PRO users are getting all this for free**. Enjoy! üòÅ

Dracula PRO is also getting a new theme - [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) is now available - including its 5 different variations: _Blade_, _Buffy_, _Lincoln_, _Morbius_, and _Van Helsing_.

If you don't know Insomnia, it's a cross-platform REST API client which is [getting pretty popular](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1366832704382136320).
