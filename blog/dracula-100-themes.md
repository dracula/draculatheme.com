Today is a special day. We have hit 100 themes on Dracula!

When I started this little project, I never imagined the community would embrace it the way it did. Thank you so much for everyone involved in this.

Let's continue to make the most cross-platform theme ever created :)

## New on Dracula

On November, 2013, Matheus [opened an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/issues/29) asking for an Eclipse theme. It took us 7 years lol, but the Eclipse theme is here. Besides that, we have a new theme for game devs.

- [Eclipse](/eclipse): A famous IDE for Java, but with support for many other languages.
- [Godot](/godot): A 2D and 3D, cross-platform, free and open-source game engine.

## New on Dracula PRO

The #1 most requested Dracula PRO theme is finally available!

Vim users, Neovim users, MacVim users, [here it is](/pro) :)

P.S.: This wouldn't be possible without the help of [D. Ben Knoble](https://github.com/benknoble) and the initial work done by [Derek Sifford](https://github.com/dsifford). You guys are the best!

## Wallpapers everywhere

Since the launch of the Dracula PRO wallpapers, lots of people started sharing their workstation.
