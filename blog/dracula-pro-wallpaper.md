Ohhh there is so much exciting news to share that I don't even know where to being.

Let's get right to it...

## New on Dracula

A new major theme has been added to Dracula - meet the official [tmux](/tmux) theme.

What I like about this one is that it has all the things you need right on your terminal like:

- Day, date, time, timezone
- Current location based on network
- Temperature and forecast
- Network connection status and SSID
- Battery percentage and AC power connection status

## New on Dracula PRO

I'm super excited to announce the Dracula PRO Wallpapers!

They are programmatically generated with JavaScript, converted to SVGs, and then exported as PNGs to fit every platform and screen size.

We spend the entire day on our computers, so having a wallpaper that consistently matches the rest of your applications is key.

And here's how it looks on a watch. It's simply gorgeous.
