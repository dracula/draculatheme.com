Today we officially crossed 300 Dracula themes! When I started this project back in 2013 with a [single commit](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/commit/7e4d17ade6a54b7b7d8037a0d2160a293f17ef5c), I never thought that one day it would become such a universal theme.

To celebrate this incredible milestone, we're launching the [new Winter drop](/shop)! This limited collection features new t-shirts, hoodies, beanies, and even posters.
