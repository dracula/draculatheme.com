I love dark mode and I've been experimenting with different setups lately. One of my favorite tools so far is [Night Eye](https://nighteye.app). What I like about this browser extension is that they convert colors instead of inverting.

Remember when I was trying to adapt one code snippet into other programming languages?

So far more than 17 languages have been added there! You can see [full GitHub thread](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/discussions/444) showing Swift, PHP, Kotlin, Ruby, Python, TypeScript, Go, Scala, and more :)
