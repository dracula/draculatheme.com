In the last blog post, I asked for your help to decide if we should use Slack or Discord to host the Dracula Community. After dozens of responses, it's clear that Discord is where the cool kids hang out nowadays, so here it is!

## Dracula in the wild

Last week a CS student from Mercer University shared his Dracula setup on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/ohw15t/qtile_dracula_theme_first_rice/).

You can see that he's using Arch Linux, Qtile window manager, and a couple of neat scripts such as [cowsay](https://github.com/piuccio/cowsay) and [pipes](https://github.com/pipeseroni/pipes.sh). Still, my favorite part is the [Alacritty Dracula theme](/alacritty).

Oh, and if you're looking for a cool background you can check his [wallpaper](https://wallhaven.cc/w/4dy2lj) too.
