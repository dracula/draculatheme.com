For the past few weeks, I've been working non-stop to make sure that Dracula, the open source project, is well organized and with fewer issues as possible. We even crossed the number of **90 themes**, which is totally insane!

I realized that people are only interested in themes because they want to be more productive. For a long time, I avoided talking about productivity tips here since that's not Dracula's primary focus. But I decided to create something new...

Now I'm going to shift my attention to Dracula PRO, but before I start making all these assumptions about what people need, I want to ask - **what's important to you?**

[Help me build this new thing](https://draculatheme.typeform.com/to/VjaC6t) by answering some questions about your dev setup.

P.S.: I know forms are boring, I hate them too, but I spent a lot of time trying to make this one suck less. Can't wait to hear what you have to say.

See ya!
