The fine folks from Microsoft invited me to talk about how to build your own VS Code theme.

On live, we explore how to choose a color palette, configure your local development environment, and even publish your theme! You can [watch it anytime here](https://youtu.be/FeApSxfazVg).

Speaking of videos, I recently ordered this fancy production service to show the behind-the-scenes of making a Dracula t-shirt. I hope you like it ;)

## The end

Q: Why don’t vampires like mosquitos?

A: Too much competition.
