These past few days have been difficult. I hope you and your family are safe! I sent refunds to all the 52 Ukrainians who bought Dracula Pro and UI. If you're a digital creator who sells products online, I encourage you to [do the same](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1499036560234221571).

On a happier note... I'm starting to ship hundreds of stickers and t-shirts this week. It's been so much work that I even asked my wife for help. I can't wait for folks to receive them!

## Dracula in the wild

I found this cool setup on Twitter from [@ItzAditya14](https://twitter.com/ItzAditya14/status/1495739451796074509). It features an Ubuntu distro with Dracula's [Gnome Terminal](/gnome-terminal), [JetBrains](/jetbrains), and [Google Chrome](/chrome) themes.
