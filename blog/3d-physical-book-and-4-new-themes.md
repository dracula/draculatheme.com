Last year I wrote an e-book called _14 Habits of Highly Productive Developers_. I made this specifically for Dracula PRO, since I wanted to help developers not only with software tools, but also with productivity tips that could assist their careers as programmers.

Today I'm excited to announce that this is now available as a physical book!

You can grab your copy now or send it as a gift to a friend:

- [English Edition](https://www.amazon.com/14-Habits-Highly-Productive-Developers/dp/1735266531)
- [Portuguese Edition](https://www.amazon.com.br/H%C3%A1bitos-Desenvolvedores-Altamente-Produtivos-Portuguese/dp/173526654X)

I also wrote an entire post about how I self-published this book on the [Dracula Blog](/blog/making-a-physical-book), which, by the way, now has an [RSS feed](/rss.xml) that you can subscribe to.
