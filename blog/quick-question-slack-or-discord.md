**In your opinion, which tool is better? Slack or Discord?**

Let me know which one you like the most.

## Dracula in the wild

Jason Evangelho from Croatia recently shared his Dracula setup on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/killyourfm/status/1390220764188663808).

What I love about it is how everything fits together well. It includes themes for [Standard Notes](/standard-notes), [Bashtop](/bashtop), [Telegram Desktop](/telegram), and [GTK](/gtk), which take the entire Linux experience to the next level.
