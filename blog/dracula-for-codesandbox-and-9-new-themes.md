I don't know about you, but I always struggle to find a good syntax highlighter library for showing code on a page. I tried almost everything like Ace, CodeMirror, Prism, Monaco Editor, Shiki, etc.

Recently, the team behind CodeSandbox created this library called [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io), which allows you to add a live-running code editor to your React app. I gave it a try, and it's pretty neat! I obviously couldn't resist creating a [Dracula theme](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/getting-started/themes#all-themes) for it, so here it is:

**Pro Tip**: In case you didn't know, you can use Dracula on CodeSandbox by typing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and searching for "Color Theme". Now you can be productive again :)
