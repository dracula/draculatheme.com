Today, I'm excited to introduce you to Lucas ([@luxonauta](https://twitter.com/luxonauta)).

He has joined Dracula to help in our mission to create the best theme for developers in the world. Lucas is a multidisciplinary front-end developer, designer, and illustrator from Brazil.

Joining Dracula enables Lucas to work with open source part-time, giving the project its first dedicated contributor. Here's a little bit more about him.

#### What led you to software development?

I was very encouraged to draw, learn new instruments, and create things from an early age. My brother and I stood out from our friends because of our love for art and astronomy.

I've always liked to share what I create, so I decided to learn the basics of web development to build a blog.

Although I had fun with programming, I always thought I would work with visual arts instead.

When it came time to choose a university course, I was lost and thought that there was no such course for me. The only options were too expensive to afford.

My parents encouraged me to study Internet Systems. I took it with a 100% scholarship, and it was the best decision I've ever made.

There I discovered CSS, and it was love at first sight! I found that I could design and code interfaces - it was the perfect combination.

#### What does a typical day look like?

I wake up very early, at 5 am, to be exact. I go to the gym, take a shower, and make some coffee. For me, this is essential.

Then, I turn on my computer and check messages on [Discord](https://discord.com/), the primary communication tool for the projects and clients I'm collaborating with.

I spend most of my time working directly with code or design; I don't usually have many meetings, and I take small breaks to eat or rest.

#### Where do you go to get inspired?

I'm always discovering new things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) and [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). Sometimes I see something that motivates and intrigues me on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/).

These are the platforms I use the most for inspiration, but I'm also always on the lookout; I can't turn it off even when I'm not working.

#### What pieces of work are you most proud of?

I'm really proud of [Luxa CSS](https://luxacss.com). This project opened up many opportunities for me. I shared it with [Zeno](https://twitter.com/zenorocha), and it was the bridge to this incredible opportunity to collaborate with him.

The work I did at Deved and with my partners at our agency Devnautas has also been great. Unfortunately, we can't show anything yet.

More recently, I've been proud of the work we've been doing to take care of and nurture the Dracula community and its products.

I'm super excited to help and build awesome stuff together!
