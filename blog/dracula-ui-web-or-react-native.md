I'm building something new... it's called [Dracula UI](/ui).

Most templates are built using light colors and later on adapted to dark colors. The process of building a dark theme shouldn't be an afterthought - **it should be a top priority**. That's why I decided to invest time in this.

But before I start developing like crazy, I want to ask - what's important to you?

What's your favorite way to build apps?

- HTML/CSS/JS?
- React Native?
- SwiftUI?
- Android?
- Flutter?

[Help me build this new thing](https://draculatheme.typeform.com/to/YvwgNntQ) by answering some questions about your dev setup :)

Happy hacking!
