First of all, I would like to say THANKS to all the Dracula users out there. Our clan continues to grow, just take a look at these crazy numbers...

👻 [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula): 1,661,819 users

🧟 [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12275-dracula-theme): 280,392 users

💀 [Atom](https://atom.io/themes/dracula-syntax): 219,224 users

Let's continue to build the most used theme for developers in the world.

## 2020 Halloween Costume Contest

As promised, today I'm here to announce the winner of our first costume contest! In case you missed, the idea was to publish a photo or screenshot of your setup on social media. The best post would get a free [Dracula PRO](/pro) license.

And the winners are... (drum roll) 🥁🥁🥁

🥇 [Eduardo](https://twitter.com/pqDuh_/status/1322294369165234182) who did a mix of ASCII art and custom shortcuts on his Window machine
