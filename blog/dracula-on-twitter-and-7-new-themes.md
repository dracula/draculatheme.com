I joined Twitter in March 2009 (yes, I'm that old), and it has been my favorite place to stay up to date with the tech community since then.

I've always wanted to create a dedicated account for Dracula but never felt like it had enough updates to keep it active. This email list made me realize that there's a TON of stuff happening in the community, so I decided to _just do it_.

You can now follow [@draculatheme](https://twitter.com/draculatheme) to get live updates every day.
