I've always admired this concept of "[open startup](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/968219339588493312)" in which people gather all their private metrics and make them public. Dracula is not a startup, but I'm all about transparency with the community, so I decided to create this [/open](/open) page to share all the numbers.

- GitHub API for repository stars
- Mailchimp API for newsletter subscribers
- Google Analytics API for website pageviews
- Twitter API for social followers
- Gumroad API for sales numbers

This was built with Next.js and I have a Redis instance on [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) to cache the data. To avoid rate limits, I have a cron job configured on [Mergent](https://mergent.co/). As always, the [code is open source](https://github.com/dracula/draculatheme.com).
