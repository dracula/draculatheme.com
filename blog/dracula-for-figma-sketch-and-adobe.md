I'm not a designer, but I'm always amazed by the kind of work these people do. Their ability to create entire screens out of a blank canvas is just incredible.

That's why I decided to spend some time to build color palettes for the most popular design apps out there. And the good news is - this is available for both PRO and open source users.

Go ahead and download the files for:

- [Adobe](/adobe)
- [Figma](/figma)
- [Sketch](/sketch)

I can't wait to see what you're all going to create :)
