2022 is here, and like everybody else, I decided to write a ["Year in Review" post](/blog/2021-year-in-review).

I'm also starting to play around with the idea of having Dracula merch! Yes, think of t-shirts, stickers, hoodies, that kind of stuff. I need your help deciding which designs look better...

**What t-shirt would you use in real-life? A or B or C?**

_Option A: Hexadecimal Shirt_
