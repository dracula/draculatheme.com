Do you know Swift, PHP, Ruby, Java, Typescript, Go, or C?

I'm trying to standardize all the Dracula screenshots using the same code snippet structure. If you know those languages, can you help me convert the following snippet ([see GitHub thread](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/discussions/444))?

## New on Dracula PRO

Last weekend I started playing around with some custom app icons. People seemed to like it, so I decided to take it to the next level.

Presenting the Dracula PRO Desktop Icons!

The 20 icons are available in 6 different flavors, just like the themes.
